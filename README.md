Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models
have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing pre-
trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content of
neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their performance
and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is frequently rooted
in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain their representational
capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an enhanced Large Brainwave
Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled improvements grounded
in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++ demonstrates substantial
gains across a variety of tasks, consistently outperforming its originally-based
architecture and achieving competitive results when compared to other open-source
LBMs. Its superior performance and training efficiency highlight its potential as a
strong foundation for future advancements in LBMs.
